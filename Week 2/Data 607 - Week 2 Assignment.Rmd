```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## The Database

We begin by creating a database to store our movies, raters, and ratings in. For this exercise, I have chosen PostgreSQL. Not only is it a popular open source choice and a robust DBMS, but it is also one of the DBMS I have not used yet.

### The Structure

The structure of the database will be simple enough. One table with movies in it, one with

`CREATE TABLE public.movies ("movieID" integer NOT NULL, "movieName" character varying(200), year integer, PRIMARY KEY ("movieID"))`

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
